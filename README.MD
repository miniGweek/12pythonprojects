# Description

A set of 12 Python Projects to help beginners get comfortable with the python language. I was looking for a set of projects which can help someone new to Python practice their skills and get comfortable with python over a period of time. Inspired by the set of of projects by freeCodeCamp.org, presented on youtube by Kyslie Ying.
